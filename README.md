# What is Yay?

![yay](docs/src/cycle.svg)

## The Idea
> Gamification can be applied to all technical and non-technical tasks during our daily working life.Everything can be gamified.

## The Implementation
Yay is an **gamification engine**, exposing a web service API, for integrating any kinds of gamification features into your organisation. Yay originally started as a hackathon project at [trivago](https://github.com/trivago) to bring gamification features to [trivago](https://github.com/trivago). Yay offers extension points to write your own integrations for connecting applications with Yay.
